# A fully functional discord bot developed for a Roblox server I administrate on.
Centrobot started out as a side project for a discord server, but I have since decided to opensource it for others to use.

# Providing Credit
I would really appreciate it if you kept the credit in the info.js file to help more people find the original source!

# Does a large server you run use Centrobot sourcecode?
Do get in touch! I'd love to know how far this small project is reaching others in the larger discord space

# 24/08/20 Update
+ Updated lodash to 4.17.20 to patch low-severity security issue
+ Assistance handlers replaced with case switches for easier modification
+ Sourcecode url added to info command

# 14/08/20 Update
+ Beginning of the repo
The bot is in active development and is used in a limited capacity on the server already (mainly for the occasional fun command right now)
