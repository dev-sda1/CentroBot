# A fully functional discord bot developed for a Roblox server I administrate on.
# The bot is in active development and is used in a limited capacity on the server already (mainly for the occasional fun command right now)


# Providing Credit
I would really appreciate it if you kept the credit in the info.js file to help more people find the original source!

# Does a large server you run use my sourcecode?
Do get in touch! I'd love to know how far this small project is reaching others in the larger discord space
