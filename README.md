# A fully functional discord bot developed for a Roblox server I administrate on.
Centrobot started out as a side project for a discord server, but I have since decided to opensource it for others to use.
There's also a trello as the project expands that you can keep an eye on [here](https://trello.com/b/FIP9LU4l/centrobot-updates)

# Does a large server you run use Centrobot sourcecode?
Do get in touch! I'd love to know how far this small project is reaching others in the larger discord space
